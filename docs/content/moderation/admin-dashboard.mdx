## Best Practices

### Reviewing Reports

1. **Read Carefully** - Review the full reason and evidence
2. **Check History** - View related reports for context
3. **Be Consistent** - Apply rules uniformly
4. **Document Actions** - Provide clear resolution messages
5. **Act Quickly** - Address high-priority reports promptly

### Taking Action

1. **Verify Evidence** - Check any provided links
2. **Consider Context** - Look at related reports
3. **Start Light** - Warning before ban when appropriate
4. **Explain Clearly** - Write resolution messages for transparency
5. **Track Patterns** - Note repeat offenders

### False Reports

If you identify false reports:
1. Dismiss the report with explanation
2. Track the reporter's history
3. Consider action if pattern of abuse
4. Document in resolution message

   - Evidence: Screenshot URL
   - Related reports: 3 other harassment reports for same user
   ↓
4. Admin selects: "Ban User"
   ↓
5. Enters resolution: "User banned for repeated hate speech violations per TOS Section 3.2"
   ↓
6. Submits action
   ↓
7. Results:
   - User banned immediately
   - Report status → Resolved
   - Reporter notified (future feature)
   - Statistics updated
   ✅ Complete

## Monitoring & Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track

- **Response Time** - Average time to resolve reports
- **Resolution Rate** - Percentage of reports resolved vs dismissed
- **Top Categories** - Which violations are most common
- **Repeat Offenders** - Users with multiple reports
- **False Report Rate** - Dismissed reports / total reports

### Health Indicators

**Healthy Community:**
- Low report volume
- High resolution rate
- Fast response times
- Few repeat offenders
- Minimal false reports

**Needs Attention:**
- Increasing report volume
- Many pending reports
- Repeat offenders not addressed
- High false report rate

---

## Troubleshooting

**Reports not loading:**
- Check admin permissions in database
- Verify authentication token
- Check browser console for errors

**Statistics not updating:**
- Refresh the page
- Check if reports were actually submitted
- Verify database connection

**Action failed:**
- Check report is still in pending/reviewing status
- Verify user still exists
- Check resolution message is provided

---

## Security Notes

- All admin actions are logged with timestamps
- Admin user ID tracked for all resolutions
- Audit trail maintained in database
- Reports cannot be deleted, only resolved/dismissed
- Banned users can be unbanned if needed
