# User Moderation Actions

Complete guide for users to block, mute, and report content.

## Overview

As a Babylon user, you have three main moderation tools:

1. **Block** - Completely hide a user and prevent interaction
2. **Mute** - Soft-hide a user's content without breaking connections
3. **Report** - Flag problematic users or posts for admin review

## Blocking Users

### What Happens When You Block

When you block a user:
- You won't see their posts in your feed
- They won't see your posts
- You'll both be automatically unfollowed
- They can't send you messages
- They won't be notified that you blocked them

### How to Block

**Via User Interface:**
1. Find a post or profile by the user
2. Click the `...` (more) button
3. Select "Block User"
4. Confirm in the modal
5. Optionally add a reason (for your own reference)

**Via API:**
```typescript
const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}/block`, {
 method: 'POST',
 headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
 body: JSON.stringify({
 action: 'block',
 reason: 'Spam posting' // optional
 })
});
```

### Managing Blocked Users

View and manage your blocked users at:
- **Settings** → **Moderation** → **Blocked** tab
- Or visit: `/settings/moderation`

From there you can:
- See all blocked users
- View when you blocked them
- See your reason for blocking
- Unblock with one click

## Muting Users

### What Happens When You Mute

When you mute a user:
- Their posts are hidden from your feed
- Your follower relationship is preserved
- They can still see your posts (if they follow you)
- They won't be notified

**Muting is softer than blocking** - use it when you want to reduce noise without completely cutting ties.

### How to Mute

**Via User Interface:**
1. Find a post or profile by the user
2. Click the `...` button
3. Select "Mute User"
4. Confirm in the modal
5. Optionally add a reason

**Via API:**
```typescript
const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}/mute`, {
 method: 'POST',
 headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
 body: JSON.stringify({
 action: 'mute',
 reason: 'Too many posts' // optional
 })
});
```

### Managing Muted Users

View and manage muted users at:
- **Settings** → **Moderation** → **Muted** tab

### How to Report
